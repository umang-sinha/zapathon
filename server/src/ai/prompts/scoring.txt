Schema
{
  "company":  "ACME Corp",

Scoring Model (text description)
IndustryScore – Give the post 1.0 when the industry is Airlines, FinTech & Payments, or Travel & Hospitality (ZapCom’s highest-priority verticals).
If the industry falls in any of the other six ZapCom pillars (Security & Compliance, Cloud Enablement & DevOps, etc.) assign 0.6.
Everything else receives 0.3.
ContentTechScore – Scan content for ZapCom-relevant technical terms (cloud, kubernetes, serverless, devops, ai, genai, automation, security, modernization, data, ml, analytics).
Count how many of those words appear (case-insensitive) and divide by 4; cap the result at 1.0.
AnnouncementTypeScore – If the post text clearly states a buying-motion phrase such as partnership, joint venture, investment, series, funding, technology launch, regional rollout, pilot, R&D milestone, scope, assign 1.0; otherwise 0.0.
HashtagScore – Look at every hashtag.
Count how many contain the strings AI, Cloud, DevOps, Security, Modernisation, Data (case-insensitive).
Divide that match count by the total number of hashtags; result ranges 0–1.
Compute each sub-score, round to three decimals, then calculate the final LeadScore by averaging the four values (equal 25 % weight each).
Round LeadScore to two decimals.
