Task: Create 50 professional LinkedIn announcement posts—each one about a new partnership, technology launch, investment, scope-of-work expansion, joint venture, regional rollout, pilot-to-production transition, or R&D milestone.
Output format: Return a single JSON array (no markdown, no commentary). Each element must be an object with four keys—company, industry, content, hashtags—structured like this:
{
  "company": "…",
  "industry": "…",
  "content": "…",   // ≥150 words, LinkedIn tone, emoji-free, third-person “we” voice
  "hashtags": ["#Tag1", "#Tag2", "#Tag3", "#Tag4"]  // 3-4 relevant tags
}
Requirements
50 unique companies (recognisable global brands; no repeats).
Cover at least these nine verticals, with multiple posts per vertical:
Airlines
Travel & Hospitality
Retail & eCommerce
FinTech & Payments
Security & Compliance
Cloud Enablement & DevOps
Data Engineering & AI Readiness
Gen AI & Intelligent Automation
App Modernisation & Product Engineering
Each content string must:
Be 150–200 words.
State the announcement theme (e.g., “strategic alliance”, “Series C investment”).
Highlight at least three concrete details (e.g., MVP timeline, projected ROI, tech stack, governance model, KPI targets, geographic rollout).
End with a forward-looking sentence (“Stay tuned…”, “More updates soon…”).
hashtags list: choose 3–4 tags that fit BOTH the company/industry and the announcement theme; camel-case multi-word tags.
No duplicate hashtags across the 50 objects except generic ones like #FinTech, #CloudComputing.
Output only the raw JSON array. No markdown wrappers, explanations, or trailing commas.
Example skeleton (do NOT repeat this text—generate fresh content):
[
  {
    "company": "Salesforce",
    "industry": "App Modernisation & Product Engineering",
    "content": "We’re thrilled to announce … (150+ words)",
    "hashtags": ["#AppModernisation", "#Salesforce", "#ProductEngineering", "#Microservices"]
  },
  { …49 more objects… }
]
